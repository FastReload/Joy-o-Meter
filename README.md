# Joy-o-Meter

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of **Joy-o-Meter**, a project for analyzing and quantifying emotions using computational data science techniques. The project was developed as part of **CS224** by **Aryan Ramachandra**.

## Features
- Emotion detection and quantification
- Data processing and visualization
- Machine learning-based analysis
- Jupyter Notebook implementation

## Repository Contents
- `CS224_Joy_o_meter_Aryan__Ramachandra.ipynb` - The main Jupyter Notebook containing the project implementation
- `README.md` - Project documentation (this file)
- `Dataset` - Uploaded with the Jupyter notebook

## Installation
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Joy-o-Meter.git
   cd Joy-o-Meter
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a requirements.txt file is not available, manually install necessary libraries based on the imports in the notebook.)*

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CS224_Joy_o_meter_Aryan__Ramachandra.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
Run the cells in the Jupyter Notebook sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and visualize results. Modify parameters as needed to experiment with different settings.

## Requirements
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- torch
- transformers
